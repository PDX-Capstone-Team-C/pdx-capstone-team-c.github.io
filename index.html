                                    <p>I am in my senior year as a computer science undergraduate student at Portland State University while working as a QA Engineering Intern at Webtrends, Inc. I previously worked as a teaching assistant for undergraduate computer science classes. I became interested in computer science while studying at the University of San Francisco through an introductory class on basic app building for the Android G1 mobile phone. In addition to programming, some other interests include hiking, camping, dragon boat racing, food, video games, and sports.</p>

                                    <p>I am a post-baccalaureate student at Portland State University in my final year of obtaining a BS in Computer Science. During the day, I work as a software development intern at Janrain through PSU’s PCEP program. I have a BA in Sociology from Brown University and spent several years working in IT support, non-profit management, volunteer coordination, and commercial construction before my second stint as a college student. In addition to learning every day, I enjoy the outdoors, board games, traveling, fine carpentry, and getting my hands dirty.</p>

                                    <p>I have one semester left until I complete my BS in Computer Science at Portland State University. I am crazy about user interface and user experience design. I love diving into the tiny details, to make programs that are simple and enjoyable to use.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to school, I work full time at a labor management company, where I do a little bit of everything, from writing an online employee scheduling and turnover database, to producing and filming employee training videos.</p>
                                    <p>When I’m not at work or school, I’m usually at home relaxing, or running around the outdoors somewhere with my wife and dog.</p>

                                    <p>In 2006, my family moved to Portland, OR from Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Even though I hate reading, I somehow managed to be a senior at PSU working on a BS in Computer Science. For the past three years, I've been working full time in the summer and part time during the school year as a Web Developer at Total Web Services. I've done websites from a single page (such as this one), to large web systems in a team development. I love my job!</p>
                                    <p>I'm interested in programming, and building something that really works as it should. I'm known as a “go-to” person for IT issues, being frequently asked to fix computers, clean PC/laptop malwares, troubleshoot and resolve technological problems. In my free time I enjoy sports, hiking, camping, biking, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, soccer, and snowboarding. The last two are my favorite, basically anything that is not as crazy as sky diving :-)</p>

                                    <p>Before my internship I worked under a PSU professor. I have done a lot of hands-on teaching with students there and have also had the opportunity to plan and execute hands-on coding tests to her students. Aside from my career, I have played soccer my entire life and it is one of my biggest hobbies. I also enjoy playing online PC games and spending time with my family.</p>

I’ve spent some time as an English teacher in Niigata, Japan and a Mandarin Chinese translator and analyst for the U.S. Navy in Hawaii. I am currently interning in DevOps at Viewpoint Construction Software as part of Portland State’s wonderful PCEP program. In my spare time I enjoy reading about history, foreign affairs, and economics, studying language (Cantonese right now) and playing around with whatever programming language/technology has my interest at the moment.</p>
